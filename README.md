Instructions for Local Setup:

Prerequisites:
Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the official website (https://www.apachefriends.org/).

Steps:
Clone Your Repository:
Open VS Code.
Use the integrated terminal in VS Code or the command prompt to navigate to the directory where you want to clone your repository.
Clone your project repository using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>

Configure XAMPP:
Open XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

Database Setup:
Open phpMyAdmin in your web browser by going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create a new database for your project, and import the database.sql file from your repository to set up the database structure and dummy data.

Update Database Configuration:
In your project directory, find the configuration file that connects your website to the database. It's typically located in a file like config.php or db.php.
Update the database connection settings (e.g., hostname, username, password, and database name) to match your local XAMPP setup.

Start the Development Server:
Open a terminal in VS Code and navigate to your project folder.
Start a local development server using the php -S localhost:8000 command (assuming your website's main file is named index.php).
Your website should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Access Your Banking Website:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access your Basic Banking Website.
You should now be able to run and test your website locally using XAMPP and VS Code. Make sure to update any additional configurations or settings specific to your project as needed.
